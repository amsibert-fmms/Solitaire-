# Repository Guidance

- Prefer Markdown tables and headings when updating documentation so the tracking workflow stays easy to skim.
- When adding code that surfaces hand tags, expose them through small helper functions on `window` for ease of integration.
- Keep statistics-related scripts under `scripts/` and mirror any CLI usage examples in the README.
- Update `docs/TODO.md` whenever you add or complete roadmap items.
