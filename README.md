# Solitaire-

This repository hosts the source code for a Solitaire web experience. The project now includes a browser-playable Klondike Solitaire implementation that supports dragging cards, recycling the stock pile, and automatically sending eligible cards to the foundations.

## Running the game locally

1. Start a lightweight static server from the repository root—for example:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   ```
2. Visit [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in your browser.
3. Interact with `index.html` to play Klondike Solitaire. Use the **New Game** button to redeal the deck at any time.

## Working with this repository

* Clone the repository locally or open it in a development container.
* Make iterative changes to the code, assets, or documentation as needed.
* Use standard Git workflows (`git status`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`) to collaborate and track history.

As an AI assistant operating inside this environment I can apply code changes directly to the repository—adding new files, updating existing ones, and running tooling—before committing the results for review.
